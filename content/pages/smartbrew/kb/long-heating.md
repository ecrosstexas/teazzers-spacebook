## Diagnostics - Phone 📞

1. Is the SmartBrew machine [turned on](/smartbrew/kb/turn-on-machine/)? [Resolved heating issue?](/resolution/102/) ☺️
2. How long is the customer saying the machine has been heating?
::: callout 
📝 *Note: If machine has been heating less than 30 minutes, let it heat a full 30 minutes before proceeding.*
::: 

  a. If over 30 minutes, machine should display a [Heater Error](/smartbrew/kb/heater-error/). If no error, double check machine is actually [turned on](/smartbrew/kb/turn-on-machine/).
3. Is the water tank temperature shown on the brew screen? Is it increasing over time?
::: callout 
📝 *Note: If no temperature is shown, firmware is out of date and needs to be [upgraded](/smartbrew/kb/outdated-firmware/) in the field 🛻.*
::: 

  a. If the temperature is not inceasing, [dispatch service](/dispatch/301/) 🛻.
4. Is this the first brew or the third brew? 
  a. If first brew, was the machine just turned back on?  It may take 20 minutes or more to heat a cold tank. 
  
  ::: callout 
  📝 *Note: The heater will turn off after 48 hours of inactivity.*
  ::: 

  b. If this is third brew in a row, does the machine have dual level probes or a single probe? If the third brew, the tank may not be refilling correctly.
  
  ::: callout 
  📝 *Machines LT00004223 and newer have dual level probes from the factory. Check the [SmartBrew changelog](/smartbrew/changelog/) for upgrade history on machines. Dispatch service to [upgrade level probe](/smartbrew/kb/add-second-probe/) as necessary. 🛻*
  ::: 
5. If still unresolved, [dispatch service](/dispatch/301/) 🛻.
