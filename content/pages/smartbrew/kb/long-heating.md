## Diagnostics - Phone

1. Is the SmartBrew machine [turned on](/smartbrew/kb/turn-on-machine/)?
2. How long is the customer saying the machine has been heating? If machine has been heating less than 20 minutes, wait at least 20 minutes before proceeding.
  a. If over 30 minutes, machine should display a [Heater Error](/smartbrew/kb/heater-error/). If no error, double check machine is actually turned on.
3. Is the water tank temperature shown on the brew screen?  What is the temperature?  Is it increasing over time?
  a. If no temperature is shown, firmware is out of date and needs to be upgraded in the field.
  b. If the temperature is not inceasing, dispatch service.
4. Is this the first brew or the third brew? 
  a. If first brew, was the machine just turned back on?  It may take 20 minutes or more to heat a cold tank. Note, the heater will turn off after 48 hours of inactivity.
  b. If third brew, does the machine have dual level probes or a single probe? Machines LT0000xxxx and up have dual probes from the factory. Check the logs for upgrade history on older machines. Dispatch service to upgrade level probe as necessary.
5. If still unresolved, dispatch service.
