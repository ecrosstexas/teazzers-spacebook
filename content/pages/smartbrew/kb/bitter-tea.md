1. Why do you think the tea is bitter? Is this a new issue? *We are trying to determine if this is a subjective, personal issue or an actual issue with the machine.*
2. Which recipe(s) is bitter?
3. When was the pinchtube last cleaned and/or rpelaced?
4. When was the urn last cleaned?
2. If this this is a sweet recipe, is there a sweetener message on the screen? 
  a. If out of sweetener, machine will stop brewing. Replace sweetener bag-in-box and rebrew.
3. Verify that the customer does have a new TEAZZERS tea filter pack in the brew basket.  If not,
  a. Rebrew with a new 2oz. TEAZZERS tea filter pack.
  b. Are they brewing with the correct tea filter pack per the recipe? *Are they brewing with black tea on a green tea recipe?*
4. Verify that the tea filter pack is actually saturated after steeping the tea and not just damp.
  a. If the filter pack is only damp the [sprayhead may be clogged](/smartbrew/kb/clogged-sprayhead/).
  b. Is the sprayhead isn't clogged, there is likely an issue with tank refilling properly.
4. Verify that all of the tea has evacuated the brew basket. If not:
  a. Carefully remove brew basket.
  b. Empty the tea and filter pack from the brew basket.
  c. Clean brew basket strainer.
5. Verify that the customer has hot water to steep the tea. Is the brew basket warm to the touch? Is the urn warmer than room temperature? 
  a. If no hot water, dispatch service.
  b. If basket is warm, check for clogged sprayhead.
  c. Once sprayhead is clean, rebrew. If problem persists dispatch service.
6. Verify that a full 2 gallons of tea was brewed into the urn.
7. If problem persists dispatch service.
