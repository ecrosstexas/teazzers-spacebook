## Possible Cause

The tablet should be locked down via Samsung Knox Configure and in Pro Kiosk mode. This limits the tablet to only running the NEWCO Touch app and prevents access to the Android operating system.

## What to Check - Field

- Turn machine off, NEWCO Touch app should remain running (although you may get a message about restarting the app)

## Action Needed - Field

1) Use Tablet Rod to tap power button for 5 seconds.
2) Choose "Exit Pro Kiosk Mode"
3) Enter 1234 in dialog box.
