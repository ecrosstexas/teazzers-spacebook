## Possible Cause

- SmartBrew machine is sharing same circuit with another unit.

## What to Check - Phone

- Circuit breaker is tripped.

- Another unit is plugged into the same outlet or on the same circuit.

- The SmartBew machine draws nearly 15 amps when the heater is on. Unless the machine shares a 30 amp circuit it is **unlikely** that the SmartBrew can share a circuit with any other machine that has a water heater.  Our recommendation is that each SmartBrew machine be connected to a dedicated 20 amp circuit.

### A note about GFCI outlets

If the SmartBrew machine is plugged into a GFCI outlet you can check to see if the outlet is tripped right at the outlet.  Press the RESET button.

If the GFCI outlet is regularly tripping, please advise the customer they will [need an electrician](/power/need-electrician/) to address the issue.

## Action Needed - Phone

1) Check to see if there is another unit that is off if the TEAZZERS unit is plugged into single use outlet.

2) [Call an electrician](/power/need-electrician/) to run a new dedicated circuit.

## Caution

- Be sure unit is on a dedicated circuit before resetting breaker.
