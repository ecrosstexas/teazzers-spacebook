## Action - Field üõª

### I. Prerequisites

- If not already open, [open the SmartBrew top and trunk panels](/smartbrew/kb/open-smartbrew/).
- [Check Thermistor](/smartbrew/kb/check-thermistor/)
- [Check Hi-Limit Switch](/smartbrew/kb/check-hi-limit/)
- [Check Heater Relay](/smartbrew/kb/check-heater-relay/)

### II. Check Continuity of Wiring

If there is still no power readings from the previous steps, then check the CONTINUITY of the wires and elements.

1. Turn power OFF to the machine.
2. Set the meter to 20K Ohms (See Figure 13)
3. Disconnect the violet w/black wire from the Common (COM) terminal of the heater relay and from the L1 side of the terminal block.
4. Place one test lead in one end. Place the second lead on the other end of the wire terminal.
5. The meter should read all zeros across the display to indicate a good wire with good connectors. If not, then replace the faulty wire(s).
6. Repeat these steps for both the violet w/white striped wires and the 4‚Äù & 21‚Äù violet w/black striped wires.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

::: callout

Before servicing the unit; be sure to disconnect the power supply completely (unplug or turn off circuit breaker). When it is advised to remove a wire to check for Voltage throughout these procedures, turn the power OFF to unit first; get yourself setup; then turn power back on to check for Voltage.

NEVER DISCONNECT LIVE WIRES FROM ANY DEVICE ON THE MACHINE. ALWAYS EXERCISE SAFETY FIRST!
