## Diagnostics - Phone üìû
1. Why do you think the tea is not sweet (enough)? Is this a new issue? *We are trying to determine if this is a subjective, personal issue or an actual issue with the machine.*
2. Which recipe(s) is not sweet (enough)?
3. Check the recipe in TeaWorld's Brew Data to verify the recipe(s) programming.
4. Is there a sweetener message on the screen? 
  a. If out of sweetener, machine will stop brewing. Replace sweetener bag-in-box and rebrew.
  b. If not out of sweetener, [check the QCD connection](/smartbrew/kb/check-qcd/).
5. Clean the sweetener system.



## Action - Field üõª

1. Confirm that the tea is actually not wweet (enough).
2. Confirm steps above from phone diagnostics.
3. Check recipes 
4. Check sweetener pump calibration.
5. Check BRIX levels (BRIX should match the recipe name on the urn image).
6. Disconnect QCD connector, clean build-up from QCD and or BIB.
7. Clean pump and flush lines with "Easy Clean", "BevClean" or similar bag-in-box cleaning solution.

##  Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è

::: callout

We are selling a program with predefind recipes.  We do not change sweetness levels to someone's personal preference.
