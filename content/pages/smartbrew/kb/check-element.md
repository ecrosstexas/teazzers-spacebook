## Action - Field 🛻

### I. Prerequisites

- If not already open, [open the SmartBrew top and trunk panels](/smartbrew/kb/open-smartbrew/).
- [Check Thermistor](/smartbrew/kb/check-thermistor/)
- [Check Hi-Limit Switch](/smartbrew/kb/check-hi-limit/)
- [Check Heater Relay](/smartbrew/kb/check-heater-relay/)
- [Check Continuity](/smartbrew/kb/check-continuity/)

### II. Check Heater Element

Check the heater element for a possible “Open-Short” or a “Short-to-Ground”

1. Turn power OFF to the machine.
2. Set the meter to 20K Ohms (See Figure 13)
3. Disconnect both of the violet w/black striped wires from the heater element terminals.
4. Place one test lead on each of the heater element terminals (See Figure 15).
5. The meter should read all zeros across the display. If not, then there could be a possible “Open-Short”. Verify by checking for a “Short-to-Ground”.
6. To check for a “Short-to-Ground”, place one test lead on either terminal of the heater element and the other on the tank lid (See Figure 16). If there are all zero’s across the display, the element has a “Short-to-Ground” and the [heater element should be replaced](/pdf/757524-heater-element-replacement.pdf).

7. If there are no zero’s across the display, the heater element has an “Open-Short” and the [heater element should be replaced](/pdf/757524-heater-element-replacement.pdf). [Resolved heating issues?](/resolution/310/) ☺️
8. Once the heater element has been removed, inspect the element for water scale, pin holes, etc.
9. Replace element if necessary. [Resolved heating issues?](/resolution/310/) ☺️

### Preventative 👨‍⚕️

If hard water or scale appears to be a problem, recommend a water filtration system.

##  Caution ⚠️

::: callout

Before servicing the unit; be sure to disconnect the power supply completely (unplug or turn off circuit breaker). When it is advised to remove a wire to check for Voltage throughout these procedures, turn the power OFF to unit first; get yourself setup; then turn power back on to check for Voltage.

NEVER DISCONNECT LIVE WIRES FROM ANY DEVICE ON THE MACHINE. ALWAYS EXERCISE SAFETY FIRST!
