## Diagnostics - Phone 📞

- Is the machine [plugged in](/smartbrew/kb/connect-machine/) 🔌?
- Is this machine [turned on]((/smartbrew/kb/turn-on-machine/))?
    - Tank should begin to heat and reach temperature within 20 minutes.
- If machine doesn't begin to heat or show any signs of operation, check for a [tripped circuit breaker](/smartbrew/kb/check-circuit-breaker/).

## What to Check - Field

- Short to ground.
- Shorted tank element.
- Burnt wires.

## Action Needed - Field

- Tripped circuit breaker: check for obvious signs of short to ground or burnt wires. Repair accordingly.

- Shorted tank element: check for element with pin hole or blown open inside tank.

1) Disconnect power, remove element wires. Set Ohm meter to 20k setting.

2) Put 1-lead on the tank lid and 1-lead on either of the element terminals. If the meter reads: "0.00" the element is shorted. Replace tank element.

3) After power has been restored to the unit, it will take approximately 15 minutes to reheat.

## Caution

- There will be expansion of water volume due to ambiant temperature heating to 205 degrees F.
