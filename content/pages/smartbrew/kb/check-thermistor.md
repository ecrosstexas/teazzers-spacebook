## What to Check - Field

- Check harness wires at the base of the thermistor for burnt wires or sealant.
- Check harness connections at main control board.
- Inspect the thermistor for water scale, pin holes, etc.

## Action - Field 🛻

1. Verify the machine is running [firmware 757531_TSB4_2020042412 or newer](/smartbrew/kb/outdated-firmware/) and update the firmware if possible as several issues with the heating circuit were fixed with this firmware.
2. [Open the SmartBrew top and trunk panels](/smartbrew/kb/open-smartbrew/).
3. Check wire harness connections at main control board for loose connections or burnt wires.
4.  Remove the thermistor by gently pulling the top of the thermistor straight upwards through the plastic grommet until the thermistor is totally removed.
5. Inspect the thermistor for water scale, pin holes, etc.
6. Clean and/or replace the thermistor as necessary. [Resolved](/smartbrew/kb/resolutions#304) ☺️?
7. If heating issues remain, [check the hi-limit switch](/smartbrew/kb/check-hi-limit/)

### Preventative 👨‍⚕️

If hard water or scale appears to be a problem, recommend a water filtration system.

##  Caution ⚠️

::: callout

Before servicing the unit; be sure to disconnect the power supply completely (unplug or turn off circuit breaker). When it is advised to remove a wire to check for Voltage throughout these procedures, turn the power OFF to unit first; get yourself setup; then turn power back on to check for Voltage.

NEVER DISCONNECT LIVE WIRES FROM ANY DEVICE ON THE MACHINE. ALWAYS EXERCISE SAFETY FIRST!
