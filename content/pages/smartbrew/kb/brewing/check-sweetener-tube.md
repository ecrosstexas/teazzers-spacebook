## Possible Cause

- Sweetener tube from BIB to pump

## What to Check - Field

- Product line restricted due to high viscosity of product or sugar crystalline accumulation.
- Product line w/strainer connections are not tight enough causing vacuum leak.
- "Change Sweetener" message not visible but BIB is empty.

## Action Needed - Field

1) Product lines need to be flushed through the pump with a line flush product e.g. "Easy Clean" weekly.
2) Replace product line w/strainer for single product line w/o strainer (p/n 757612).

## Caution
