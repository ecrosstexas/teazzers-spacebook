## Possible Cause

- Transformer

## What to Check - Field

- Loose fitting or burnt terminals or wires.
- Lights on main & Bluetooth boards are not lit.
- Burned internal primary/secondary wire(s) (not visible from exterior).

## Action Needed - Field

1) Be sure terminals are tight. Repair burnt wires accordingly.
2) If wires check out, use a Volt meter to check for power on both sides of the transformer. Between black and white wires should read 110-120VAC. Between the black w/white striped wires should read 24-26VAC. From each black w/white striped wires to the brown wire should read 12-13VAC.
3) If none of the voltages are read, replace the transformer.

## Caution
