## Possible Cause

- Product levels don't match calibration figures.

## What to Check - Phone

- Crystalline accumulation in QCD Bag-In-Box connector.

## What to Check - Field

- Obvious signs of product leaking from any of the product line connections.
- Elbows on pump leaking product.
- Product lines restricted due to high viscosity of product or sugar crystalline accumulation.
- Pump runs slow or seizes momentarily during brew cycle.

## Action Needed - Phone

1) Clean and reconnect QCD connector.

## Action Needed - Field

1) Tighten connections.
2) Pump elbows need to be tightened.
3) Product lines need to be flushed through the pump with a line flush product e.g. "Easy Clean" weekly.
4) Replace sweetener pump.
5) Check "Sweetener" calibration and adjust as needed. Ensure the yellow shut-off knob is full vertical on sweetener valve.
6) Replace black sweetner flow control valve.

## Caution
