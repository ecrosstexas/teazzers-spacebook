## Possible Issue(s)

- Check wires loose connections or burnt wires or sealant.
- Check reset button.

## Action Needed - Field

- Step 1 ‚Äì Verify the machine is running firmware 757542-3 or newer and update the firmware if possible as several issues with the heating circuit were fixed with this firmware.
- Step 2 - Remove the top cover to reveal the tank and tank lid assembly, by removing the 6 screws on the top of the machine.
- Step 3 - Remove the front cover panel to expose the internal plumbing and wiring of the machine. Start by loosening the 3 screws on one side of the panel and then removing the 3 screws on the opposite side. You can now slide the panel sideways toward the side where the screws were removed.
- Step 4 - Check the wire connections to both sides of the heater element as well as the hi-limit switch, for loose connections or burnt wires.
- Step 5 - Check to see if the ‚ÄúRED or BROWN‚Äù reset button on top of the hi- limit switch has been tripped (UP position). If tripped, then attempt to reset it by firmly pushing the button down until a click sound is heard. Now attempt to reheat the tank and check for a boiling water condition. If the switch will not reset, then replace the defective hi-limit switch.
