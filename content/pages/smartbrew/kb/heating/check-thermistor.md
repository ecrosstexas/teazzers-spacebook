## Possible Issue(s)

- Thermistor Malfunction

## What to Check - Field

- Check harness wires at the base of the thermistor for burnt wires or sealant.
- Check harness connections at main control board.
- Inspect the thermistor for water scale, pin holes, etc.
- Open thermistor error.

## Action Needed - Field

- Step 1 – Verify the machine is running firmware 757542-3 or newer and update the firmware if possible as several issues with the heating circuit were fixed with this firmware.
- Step 2 - Remove the top cover to reveal the tank and tank lid assembly, by removing the 6 screws on the top of the machine.
- Step 3 - Remove the front cover panel to expose the internal plumbing and wiring of the machine. Start by loosening the 3 screws on one side of the panel and then removing the 3 screws on the opposite side. You can now slide the panel sideways toward the side where the screws were removed.
- Step 4 - Check wire harness connections at main control board for loose connections or burnt wires.
- Step 5 - Remove the thermistor by gently pulling the top of the thermistor straight upwards through the plastic grommet until the thermistor is totally removed.
- Step 6 – Inspect the thermistor for water scale, pin holes, etc.
- Step 7 - Clean and/or replace the thermistor as necessary
- Step 8 – If hard water or scale appears to be a problem, recommend a water filtration system.
