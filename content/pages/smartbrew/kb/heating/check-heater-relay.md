## Possible Issue(s)

- [Weak Tea](/smartbrew/kb/weak-tea/)
- [No Hot Water](/smartbrew/kb/no-heat/)
- [Overheat Error](/smartbrew/kb/overheat-error/)

## Action Needed - Field

### I. Prerequisites

- If not already done, [open the SmartBrew top and trunk panels](/smartbrew/kb/open-machine/).
- [Check Thermistor](/smartbrew/kb/check-thermistor/)
- [Check Hi-Limit Switch](/smartbrew/kb/check-hi-limit/)

### II. Check Heater Relay

If there is no voltage reading at the hi-limit switch then test the connections at the heater relay.

- Step 1 – Disconnect the violet w/black stripe wire from the Common (COM) terminal of the heater relay (See Figure 6).
- Step 2 - Place one test lead from the meter to the disconnected violet/black wire terminal (See Figure 8). Place the other lead on the neutral side of terminal block or ground (See Figure 9 or Figure 10). It should read 120VAC. If not, then [check for continuity](/smartbrew/kb/check-continuity-heater-wiring/).
- Step 3 – If we do read 120VAC, then reconnect the violet w/black stripe wire to the COM terminal of the heater relay.
- Step 4 – Remove the violet w/black wire going from the heater relay to the hi-limit switch.
- Step 5 - Place one test lead from the meter to the disconnected violet/black wire terminal. Place the other lead on the neutral side of terminal block or ground (See Figure 9 or Figure 10). It should read 120VAC. If not, then [check for continuity](/smartbrew/kb/check-continuity-heater-wiring/).
- Step 6 - Then disconnect the red and blue 12VDC wires from the heater relay (See Figure 6). 
- Step 7 – Set the meter to 200DCV as in Figure 12.
- Step 8 - Connect the test leads to these 12VDC relay connectors (See Figure 11).
- Step 9 - If there is a 12-17VDC reading on the red and blue wires and there is 120VAC reading on the violet w/black wire from the terminal block to the Common (COM) terminal on the heater relay, but no voltage from the Normally Open (NO) terminal to the hi-limit thermostat switch, then replace the defective heater relay.
- Step 10 - If not, then [check for continuity](/smartbrew/kb/check-continuity-heater-wiring/).
- Step 11 - If the continuity of the wires is ok, then the main system board maybe defective.

## ⚠️ Caution

::: callout

Before servicing the unit; be sure to disconnect the power supply completely (unplug or turn off circuit breaker). When it is advised to remove a wire to check for Voltage throughout these procedures, turn the power OFF to unit first; get yourself setup; then turn power back on to check for Voltage.

NEVER DISCONNECT LIVE WIRES FROM ANY DEVICE ON THE MACHINE. ALWAYS EXERCISE SAFETY FIRST!
