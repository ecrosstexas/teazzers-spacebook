## Possible Cause

- Heater Relay.

## What to Check - Field

- Doesn't engage.

## Action Needed - Field

1) Disconnect power and remove the purple w/black stripe wire from the relay going to the terminal block.

2) Using a Volt meter force 1-lead into the terminal. Reconnect power. Touch the other terminal to any part to the chassis or neutral wire on the terminal block. Should read 110-120VAC. If not replace.

3) If the meter reads 110-120VAC, disconnect power, replace purple w/black stripe wire in relay. Remove the purple w/black wire from the relay going to the tank element. Reconnect the power.

4) Place 1-lead on the exposed male terminal on the relay and the other lead anywhere on the chassis or neutral wire on the terminal block. Should read 110-120VAC.

5) If not disconnect power. Remove red & black wires from the relay. Connect leads to both terminals. reconnect power. Should read 9-12VDC. If the meter reads 9-12VDC replace relay.

6) If not disconnect power and use Ohm meter to check each wire seperately for continuity between terminal to harness. Set for 20k Ohms. Should read "0.00". If not, replace bad harness. If the meter does read "0.00" the main board may be defective. Replace main board.
