The SmartBrew machine has a hot water tank which heats the brew water to around 200 degrees, which is then used to “steep” or “brew” the tea leaves contained within the tea filter bag. A typical heater element is used to heat the brew water within the tank, and a hi-limit thermostat switch is used to prevent the tank from overheating. In addition, a thermistor is used to monitor and report the actual temperature within the tank.
