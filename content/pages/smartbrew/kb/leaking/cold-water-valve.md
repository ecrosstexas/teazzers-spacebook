## Possible Cause

- Cold water dilution solenoid valve.
- Sweetner solenoid valve.

## What to Check - Field

- With power disconnected, water continues to run after approximately 30 seconds.

## Action Needed - Field

- To determine which valve is leaking, disconnect the flexable hoses from the plastic elbows. Once it is determined which valve it is, use the following options:

1) If the valve seat is scarred, replace the valve.
2) If the valve seat is not scarred but the plunger rubber seat is, replace with a plunger repair kit.
3) Replace the entire assembly.

## Caution
