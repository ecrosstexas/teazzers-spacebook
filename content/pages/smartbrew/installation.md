## SmartBrew Onsite Setup Instructions
**After physical installation is completed.**

### Step 1. Power Up Tablet

 1) Turn the SmartBrew machine ON. Power switch is located on the back of the machine.
 2) Tablet should boot up and start the Teazzers SmartBrew application. It is also referred to as the
 NewCo Touch application. (See Troubleshooting section below if tablet does not bootup)

### Step 2. Verify WiFi or Cell Signal

1) Turn the SmartBrew machine OFF
2) Tablet should now display the Teazzers wallpaper warning about doing a factory reboot.
3) Swipe up toward the top of the screen
4) You should now have access to the “Settings” application. Note: It may be located in the HIDE
folder.
5) Verify that “Mobile Data” is turned on.
6) Scroll down to the “About Tablet” item and verify that a phone number is displayed in the “My
phone number” field. (If not, see troubleshooting section)
7) Click on “Status” and make note of the Signal Strength. Please write this value on the installation
report which is sent back to Teazzers.
Note: A signal of -60dBm is nearly perfect and -112dBm is considered poor. Anything above - 87 is considered the equivalent of having 4 bars.

1) From the SmartBrew application, access the Admin/Programming screen by clicking on the
screen and entering the default Admin password of “13375” at the login prompt.
2) From the menu, choose “Network Setup”
3) Verify the Machine ID matches the machine serial number attached to both the back of the
machine as well as inside the BIB compartment. The ID should start with “LT” followed by 4 leading zeros, followed by a 4 digit number. For example ....“LT00003123”.
 Be sure there is no space after the “LT”.
