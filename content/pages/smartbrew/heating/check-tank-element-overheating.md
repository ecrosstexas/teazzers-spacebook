## Possible Cause

- Tank element.

## What to Check - Field

- Internal element coil is exposed to water in tank and can cause the element to continuously heat.

## Action Needed - Field

- Shorted tank element: element has pin hole or has blown open inside tank.

1) Disconnect power, remove element wires. Set Ohm meter to 20k setting. Put 1-lead on the tank lid and 1-lead on either of the element terminals. If the meter reads: "0.00" the element is shorted. Replace tank element.

2) After power has been restored to the unit, it will take approximately 15 minutes to reheat.

## Caution

- NOTE: there will be expansion of water volume due to ambient temperature heating to 205 degrees F.
