## Possible Cause

- [Tripped circuit breaker](/power/check-circuit-breaker/).
- [SmartBrew machine unplugged](/power/connect-machine/).
- [Power switch in "OFF" position](/power/turn-on-machine/).

## What to Check - Phone

- Plug machine in.
- Turn machine "ON"

## What to Check - Field

- Short to ground.
- Shorted tank element.
- Burnt wires.

## Action Needed - Field

- Tripped circuit breaker: check for obvious signs of short to ground or burnt wires. Repair accordingly.

- Shorted tank element: check for element with pin hole or blown open inside tank.

1) Disconnect power, remove element wires. Set Ohm meter to 20k setting.

2) Put 1-lead on the tank lid and 1-lead on either of the element terminals. If the meter reads: "0.00" the element is shorted. Replace tank element.

3) After power has been restored to the unit, it will take approximately 15 minutes to reheat.

## Caution

- There will be expansion of water volume due to ambiant temperature heating to 205 degrees F.
