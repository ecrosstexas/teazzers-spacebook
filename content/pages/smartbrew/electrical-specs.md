## ðŸ”Œ Electrical Specs

| Model | Control | Description | P | Hz | Wire | Volts | Watts | Amps | US Plug | Canada Plug |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TSB4 | Touch | Smart Brew | 1 | 60 | 2+G | 120 | 1650 | 14.3 | 5-15 | 5-20 |

Other power ratings are available.  Optional 240 V cord with plug cap may be specified for 240 V units.  Units are not voltage convertible without component/wiring changes.  For brewers without an attached cord set, use an appropriately sized, UL (CSA in Canada) listed, grounding type power cable.  If brewer is hard wired to a junction box, ensure that the length of the power cable is adequate to allow the equipment to be moved for cleaning the counter underneath.

## Installation Instructions

- Brewer should be installed on a secure, level, surface capable of fully supporting the weight of the brewer, including the water retained in the brewer, sweetener to be placed in the lower compartment, and any fully loaded dispenser(s) that may be placed on the brewer.
- A grounded electrical connection to a circuit that meets the electrical specifications of the brewer and is protected by the appropriate size and type of breaker is required.
