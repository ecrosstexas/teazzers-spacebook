## 📞 Diagnostics - Phone

### Step 1
- Why do you think the tea is weak? Is this a new issue? Which recipe(s) is weak?
::: callout 
📝 *Tip: We are trying to determine if this is a subjective, personal issue or an actual issue with the machine.*
::: 
### Step 2
- If this this is a sweet recipe, is there a sweetener message on the screen? 
  a. If out of sweetener, machine will stop brewing. [Replace sweetener](/smartbrew/check-bib/) bag-in-box and rebrew. [Resolved](/resolution/213/)?
### Step 3
- Verify that the customer does have a new TEAZZERS tea filter pack in the brew basket.  If not,
  a. Rebrew with a new 2oz. TEAZZERS tea filter pack.
  b. Are they brewing with the correct tea filter pack per the recipe? 
  ::: callout 
  📝 *Tip: Different teas have different tastes. Are they brewing with green tea on a black tea recipe?*
  ::: 
### Step 4
- Verify that the tea filter pack is actually saturated after steeping the tea and not just [damp](/smartbrew/dry-tea-bag/).
  a. If the filter pack is only damp the [sprayhead may be clogged](/smartbrew/clogged-sprayhead/).
  b. If the sprayhead isn't clogged, there is likely an issue with [tank refilling](/smartbrew/tank-not-refilling/) properly.
### Step 5
- Verify that all of the tea has evacuated the brew basket. If not:
  a. Carefully remove brew basket.
  b. Empty the tea and filter pack from the brew basket.
  c. Clean brew basket strainer.
### Step 6
- Verify that the customer has hot water to steep the tea. Is the brew basket warm to the touch? Is the urn warmer than room temperature? 
  a. If no hot water, [dispatch service](/dispatch/301/). 🛻 
  b. If basket is warm, check for [clogged sprayhead](/smartbrew/clogged-sprayhead/), clean, and rebrew.
  c. Verify that a full 2 gallons of tea was brewed into the urn. Less than 2 gallons indicates there is a water issue.
### Step 7 
- Is the water filtered? Is so, how?
::: callout 
📝 *Tip: On rare occasisons, the water source can be so filtered that there aren't enough minerals to pick up the tea flavor.*
::: 
### Step 8
- If problem persists [dispatch service](/dispatch/). 🛻 



## 🛻 Action - Field

1. Confirm that the tea is actually weak.
2. Confirm steps above from phone diagnostics.
3. Confirm [max temperature setting](/smartbrew/max-temperature-setting/) is appropriate for the location's altitude. If temperature setting is too low, it will not steep tea correctly.
3. If there is no hot water...
  a. Check the common reasons the SmartBrew machine has [no hot water](/smartbrew/common-no-hot-water/)
  b. Check the [thermistor](/smartbrew/check-thermistor/).
  c. Check the [hi-limit-switch](/smartbrew/check-hi-limit/).
  d. Check the [heater relay](/smartbrew/check-heater-relay/).
  e. Check the [wiring continuity](/smartbrew/check-continuity-heater-wiring/).
  f. Check the [tank heater element](/smartbrew/check-element/).
4. If the urn does not have a full 2 gallons or the filter pack is only getting damp...
  a. Check proper [water level in tank](/smartbrew/tank-not-refilling/).
  b. Check [recipe](/smartbrew/check-recipe/) and make sure it has a temperature of 200 degrees, 64 oz. of brew water, and 192 oz. of make-up water.
  c. Check [calibration](/smartbrew/check-calibration/)
  d. Check [dump valve](/smartbrew/check-dump-valve/)
