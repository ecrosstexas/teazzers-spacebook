## Issue

The Android operating system is hidden away as much as possible to prevent changes to the OS that would negatively impact SmartBrew machine operation.

## Action Needed - Field

1) [Exit Pro Kiosk Mode](/power/exit-pro-kiosk-mode/) if you haven't already.

2) Swipe Up on the bottom of the Warning Screen
