While the SmartBrew machine is not yet running, TEAZZERS has done all it can do to solve the issue.  Please contact an plumber to install and/or examine the circuit the SmartBrew machine is plugged into.

The SmartBew machine draws nearly 15 amps when the heater is on. Unless the machine shares a 30 amp circuit it is unlikely that the SmartBrew can share a circuit with any other machine that has a water heater.  Our recommendation is that each SmartBrew machine be connected to a dedicated 20 amp circuit.
