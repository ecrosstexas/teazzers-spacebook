## Possible Cause

- Sweetener BRIX level

## What to Check - Phone

- [Check QCD](/brewing/check-qcd/)

## What to Check - Field

- Product line has crystalline build-up.
- Pump partially bound up with crystalline buil-up.
- BRIX doesn't match recipes.

## Action Needed - Field

1) Connect line flush cleaner e.g. "Easy Clean" and run through pump.
2) Disconnect QCD connector, clean build-up from QCD and or BIB.
3) Reconnect and flush lines with "Easy Clean".
4) Replace product line.
5) Replace sweetner pump.
6) Check recipes and recalibrate valves as needed.

## Caution

We are selling a program with predefind recipes.  We do not change sweetness levels to someone's personal preference.
