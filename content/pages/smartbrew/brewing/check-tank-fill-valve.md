## Possible Cause

- Tank fill solenoid valve

## What to Check - Field

- Loose or burnt wires to coil.
- Coil is shorted (unseen from exterior).
- In/out fittings or valve clogged with water sediment.

## Action Needed - Field

- Use a Volt meter & check across coil terminals. Should read 110-120VAC.

1) If there is a correct reading replace the solenoid valve.
2) If not, place 1-lead on the gray terminal and the other lead anywhere on the chassis.
3) If there is power the coil is bad. Replace solenoid valve.
4) If not check continuity on the gray wire to the harness connector with an Ohm meter set to 20k.
5) Check the white neutral wire for continuity. If both wires check out replace the main control board.

## Caution
